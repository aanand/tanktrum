 * Figure out a good cross-platform place to store the username file or remove
   it or something because at the moment it gets put wherever the current
   working directory is, which is something like / on macs, ~ on linux and god
   knows where on windows.

 * Go back and rework tank physics again.  Egglet says that tanks shouldn't get
   stuck quite so much and he is basically the deathtank expert.  Also, the
   slipping down hills seems to be worse again recently.

 * When a new round is started, if the new ground heightmap takes a while to get
   to the players, the old ground is displayed until it does.

 * Network crapness can cause lag in gun aiming and weapon cycling, which is irritating.
   If there aren't any hidden dangers, and I can't think of any, each player's
   client should probably be the authority on the following variables, with the
   server keeping stale copies and broadcasting them to the other players:
    - gunAngle
    - gunAngleChange
    - gunPower
    - gunPowerChange
    - selectedWeapon
