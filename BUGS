 * Figure out a good cross-platform place to store the username file or remove
   it or something because at the moment it gets put wherever the current
   working directory is, which is something like / on macs, ~ on linux and god
   knows where on windows.

 * Fix the bug that happens when someone joins in the middle of a round and
   they don't get the ground sent until an explosion happens.
 
 * For that matter, don't allow joining in the middle of a round, or have
   someone only able to spectate until the round is over (simply by just not
   creating a tank for them.)

 * Go back and rework tank physics again.  Egglet says that tanks shouldn't get
   stuck quite so much and he is basically the deathtank expert.  Also, the
   slipping down hills seems to be worse again recently.
