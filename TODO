This is a list of things that need to be done before release:
 
 * Choose a name.  Possibilities so far are:
   - Boom Trapezoid
   - Totenpanzer
   - Horror Tank
   - ...

 * Clean up server and client classes, separating all network stuff from game
   logic stuff.

 * Game search.  Servers need names and there should be a thing where you can
   search for servers by name or just find ones with a low ping to you.

 * Set up a proper bug tracking/ticketing system.

 * More sound effects/music:
   - Opening theme (also an opening graphic).
   - Background sound (I like the idea of gentle bird song at the moment).
   - Sound effects for each of the weapons/special items.
   - Sound effect for moving?
   - Death sound.

 * Tweaking of money and existing weapons.
   - Explosions possibly need a "damage factor" for how much damage they do per
     unit of intersection with a tank.
   - Scoring and prices needs balancing and a decision made whether to stick
     with points and money per point of damage or to go with the traditional
     deathtank system.
   - Nuke: Possibly needs to do even more damage.
   - Roller mines probably need rethinking again, there is some jitter
     currently.  Trying to do projectile physics as interpolation on the client
     isn't quite working yet still.  Probably need to do some structured
     thinking about this instead of just hacking and praying.
   - Also need to check how Roller Mines are represented on the HUD in DTZ,
     having a blue circle is just wrong and confusing for the blue tank.  Maybe
     change to a circle with some arcs around it for now.
   - Different projectiles need to have different reload times.

 * Weapons still to be implemented:
   - Machine Gun: Should be simple, lots of rectangular projectiles.
   - Missiles: Missile shaped projectile, normal damage and explosion, left and
     right controls affect any missiles the player has fired instead of the
     tank.
   - MIRV: Normal projectile to start with, splits into 5 projectiles as soon
     as Y velocity < 0 (apex of the shot).  Possibly after a minimum time.
   - Air Strike: "Shooting down the planes will cause them to break open and
     drop all of remaining bombs at once." Yes.
   - Death's Head: Big MIRV.
   - Carbomite: On death create an explosion with radius relative to the amount
     of carbomite purchased.

 * Other items that can be bought and need to be implemented:
   - Jump Jets: Yes.  Give some lift.  Need to play with these in DTZ again to
     remember exactly how they work.  Experiment.
   - Shields: Create a circle around the tank, if a projectile is in the circle
     (same test as between a tank and an explosion), give it a push away,
     possibly proportional to how far inside the circle it is.
   - Target Computer: There is some maths here that will need to be done.
     Should probably display as a translucent circle of the colour of the
     owner.
   - Hover Coil: Whee.  Again, needs experimentation.  Possibility of just not
     including this and allowing multiple purchases of Jump Jets.

 * Special weapon drops are a thing that should happen eventually too, but
   they're not really a priority right now.
