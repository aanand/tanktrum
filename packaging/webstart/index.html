                    There should be a server running on <b>boomtrapezoid.com</b> on the default port (10000). If
                    there isn't then find some friends and start your own, unless you're a
                    terrible sociopath, in which case this expression is recommended:

            <h2>Okay, so.</h2>
    
            <p>
                We started work on this a few weeks before <a href="http://www.deathtank.com/">discovering</a>
                that a game called Death Tank appears to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade. While that's great
                (the whole reason we started this thing is so we could play Death Tank online) it's admittedly
                somewhat dispiriting - damn it, <em>we</em> were doing that!
            </p>
    
            <p>
                However, we can think of several reasons this is still worth people's time:
            </p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>
                    We're not charging money for it!
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    Their version might turn out to be rubbish!
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    You can play this on any PC or Mac or Linux machine, not just an Xbox 360!
                </li>
        
                <li>
                    We're staggeringly cool people, and you definitely want to be seen playing
                    our game.

            <p>
                There aren't all of the weapons in
                there, and hardly any sounds either. So we've got some way to go.
                That's fine. We will DEFINITELY NOT give up on it, yet.
            </p>
    
            <p>
                Pretty soon we'll put the source code up somewhere, probably on Github.
                Then, if you are as cool as we are, you can start hacking around with
                it.
