    <h1>(An incomplete clone of) Death Tank!</h1>
    
    <p>
        God damn! Look at this! We've implemented, like, <i>an amount</i>
        of that classic Sega Saturn easter egg, Death Tank Zwei, in an online-multiplayer
        capacity!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        <img src="screenshot.png">
    </p>
    
    <h2>Quick start!</h2>
    
    <p>
        <a href="tank.jnlp">Click here to play it right the hell now!</a><br>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>You'll need a Java - any old 1.5+ will do.</li>

        <li>
            There should be a server running on <b>norgg.org</b> on the default port. If
            there isn't then find some friends and start your own, unless you're a
            terrible sociopath, in which case this expression is recommended:
            <kbd>:(</kbd>
        </li>

        <li>
            You will be asked to accept a security certificate. We recommend that you
            do so, or you'll not be able to play it, and clicking on that link will have
            been a gigantic waste of your time.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Controls</h3>

    <p>
        <b>A</b> moves left.<br/>
        <b>D</b> moves right.<br/>
        <b>Left and right arrows</b> aim.<br/>
        <b>Up and down arrows</b> control gun power.<br/>
        <b>Space</b> fires.<br/>
        <b>Tab</b> changes weapon.<br/>
        <b>Arrow keys</b> and <b>Enter</b> control the menus.<br/>
        <b>T</b> is for chat.<br/>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Okay, so.</h2>
    
    <p>
        We started work on this a few weeks before
        <a href="http://www.gamerbytes.com/2008/08/oh_son_its_death_tank.php">it was reported</a>
        that a game called Death Tank appears to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade. If indeed this is
        the Death Tank of old times, then while that's great (the whole reason we started this thing
        is so we could play Death Tank online) it's admittedly somewhat dispiriting - damn them! We
        were doing that!
    </p>
    
    <p>
        However, we can think of several reasons this is still worth people's time:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            We're not charging money for it!
        </li>
        
        <li>
            Hey, what if it's not even <i>the</i> Death Tank coming out on XBLA, but just some game
            that happens be called Death Tank, or - gasp - some kind of rubbishy sequel with none of
            the original's raw charm? Our game will be better! Better than an actual real game someone
            is charging money for!
        </li>
        
        <li>
            You can play this on any PC or Mac or Linux machine, not just an Xbox 360! That means you
            can tell your mum about it on MSN and be blowing up a polygonal representation of a tank
            she's controlling, literally within seconds!
        </li>
        
        <li>
            That port's probaby being churned out by a faceless corporation somewhere. Seriously, we
            bet it's called CloneCorp or Game Porting Solutions or some shit. They probably have to
            wear four ties to work. Whereas we are some <i>extremely</i> cool people. If you met us
            at a party it would be the best party you had been to in at least a week. No joke.
        </li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>
        Puts it all in perspective, right? You <i>definitely</i> want to be seen playing the Death Tank
        clone written by the cool people.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Now, help us out.</h2>
    
    <p>
        First things first: Obviously, we're not going to call it Death Tank. That would be rude, and
        possibly illegal. So, if you can think of a brilliant name that is <b>at least as stupid</b> and
        <b>at least as pithy</b>, help us out! Here are some we have considered:
    </p>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Totenpanzer</li>
        <li>Horrortank</li>
        <li>Boom Trapezoid</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h3>You could even help us develop it!</h3>
    
    <p>
        It's not even nearly finished yet. There are hardly any of the weapons in there, and hardly any
        sounds either. So we've got some way to go. That's fine. We will DEFINITELY NOT give up on it,
        yet.
    </p>
    
    <p>
        Pretty soon we'll put the source code up somewhere, probably on Github. Then, if you are as
        cool as we are, you can start hacking around with it.
    </p>
    
    <h2>In any case, come hang out with us.</h2>
    
    <p>
        In IRC, that is. Right <a href="irc://irc.synirc.net#deathtank">here</a>.
