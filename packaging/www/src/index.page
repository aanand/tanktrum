            There should be a server running on <b>boomtrapezoid.com</b> on the default port (10000). If
            there isn't then find some friends and start your own, unless you're a
            terrible sociopath, in which case this expression is recommended:
            <kbd>:(</kbd>
        </li>

        <li>
            You will be asked to accept a security certificate. We recommend that you
            do so, or you'll not be able to play it, and clicking on that link will have
            been a gigantic waste of your time.

    <h2>Okay, so.</h2>

    <p>
        We started work on this a few weeks before <a href="http://www.deathtank.com/">discovering</a>
        that a game called Death Tank appears to be coming to Xbox Live Arcade. While that's great
        (the whole reason we started this thing is so we could play Death Tank online) it's admittedly
        somewhat dispiriting - damn it, <em>we</em> were doing that!
    </p>

    <p>
        However, we can think of several reasons this is still worth people's time:
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            We're not charging money for it!
        </li>

        <li>
            Their version might turn out to be rubbish!
        </li>

        <li>
            You can play this on any PC or Mac or Linux machine, not just an Xbox 360!
        </li>

        <li>
            We're staggeringly cool people, and you definitely want to be seen playing
            our game.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <b>Space</b> fires.<br>

        <b>Arrow keys</b> and <b>Enter</b> control the menus.<br>

    <h2>It's not even nearly finished.</h2>

    <p>
        The netcode and physics are still somewhat rough around the edges.
        There aren't all of the weapons in there, and hardly any sounds either.
        So we've got some way to go. That's fine. We will DEFINITELY NOT give up on it, yet.
    </p>

    <p>
        The source code is <a href="http://github.com/aanand/boomtrapezoid">on Github</a>.
        On a whim, it's written in Scala, which is turning out to be quite a pleasant language.
        So go ahead! Fork it! Play with it! Change stuff! Mess around!
