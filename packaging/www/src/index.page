            There should be a server running on <b>boomtrapezoid.com</b> on the default port (10000). If
            there isn't then find some friends and start your own, unless you're a

    <h2>Okay, so.</h2>
    This here is a game about trapezoids that go boom.  A complicated concept,
    I know, but we're sure you'll grasp it with time.  It has been inspired by
    some things.  A rich history of explosions, parabolas, primitive shapes and
    the deep, deep stories of the conflicts between them.  Here are some in a
    list:

    <ul>
        <li>
            It all started in BASIC in 1979.  With a game called Artillery.  No
            advanced graphics here, just code and numbers and command lines.
            You even had to type in the code for the thing from a magazine.
            The <a href="http://github.com/aanand/boomtrapezoid">code</a> for
            Boom Trapezoid would take quite a while to type out from a
            magazine, it's about 10,000 words so far.
        </li>

        <li>
            A bit later, after some revisions of the BASIC game, someone made a
            game with some graphics, imaginatively named it Artillery, and put
            it on an Apple II in 1981.
        </li>

        <li>
            Scorched Earth first happened in 1991, providing players with a
            choice of weapons and other tools for the first time.
        </li>

        <li>
            Worms happened in 1995.  It added some cute and sold lots.
        </li>

        <li>
            Death Tank happened in 1996.  It added real time.  7 people would
            sit, squeezed round a TV, pressing buttons and shouting at each
            other.
        </li>

    <h2>It's not even nearly finished.</h2>

    <p>
        The netcode and physics are still somewhat rough around the edges.
        There aren't all of the weapons in there, and hardly any sounds either.
        So we've got some way to go. That's fine. We will DEFINITELY NOT give up on it, yet.
    </p>

    <p>
        The source code is <a href="http://github.com/aanand/boomtrapezoid">on Github</a>.
        On a whim, it's written in Scala, which is turning out to be quite a pleasant language.
        So go ahead! Fork it! Play with it! Change stuff! Mess around!
